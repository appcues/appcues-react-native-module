# Observing Analytics

A event listener can be registered to allow for the host application to see all of the analytics that are being tracked by the Appcues React Native Module.

## Registering the Event Listener

You can register to receive Appcues analytics events using `addListener` with an `eventType` of `analytics` on the `NativeEventEmitter` class:

```js
import { NativeEventEmitter, NativeModules } from 'react-native';

...

// Add the listener
const eventEmitter = new NativeEventEmitter(NativeModules.AppcuesReactNative);
const eventListener = eventEmitter.addListener('analytics', ({analyticType, value, properties, isInternal}) => {
    // analyticType: Enum string indicating the type of the analytic. Possible values listed below.
    // value: String containing the primary value of the analytic being tracked. For events - the event name, for screens - the screen title, for identify - the user ID, for group - the group ID.
    // properties: Object containing the properties that provide additional context about the analytic.
    // isInternal: Boolean indicating if the analytic was internally generated by the SDK, as opposed to passed in from the host application.
    console.log(analyticType, value, properties, isInternal);
});

...

//Removes the listener
eventListener.remove();
 ```

## Using the Analytics Tracking Data

There are four different possible values for `analyticType` and two possible values for `isInternal`:

| `analyticType` | `isInternal` | SDK call              |
| -------------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| `EVENT`        | `true`       | N/A                   |
| `EVENT`        | `false`      | `Appcues.track()`     |
| `SCREEN`       | `false`      | `Appcues.screen()`    |
| `IDENTIFY`     | `false`      | `Appcues.identitfy()` |
| `GROUP`        | `false`      | `Appcues.group()`     |

Events with `isInternal == true` correspond to internal SDK events - these capture anything that is generated automatically inside of the Appcues SDK, including flow events and session events.

All other analytics - these are all the screens, events, user or group identities that are passed into the SDK from the host application have `isInternal == false`.
